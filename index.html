                <h3>Our turtle hatcheries</h3><br>
                <p>Turtles are reptiles of the order Chelonii. Therefore they are also called chelonians by researchers and conservationists. Chelonians are charaterized by the special bony shell or carapace, which is developed from their ribs and acts as a shield. They are an old group with the very first proto-turtles having evolved over 220 milliom years ago in the Triassic Era. The order of Chelonii, also known as the Testudines, have three members in the group; turtles, tortoises and terrapins.

                    Turtles: In North America the word indicates all chelonians, including tortoises and terrapins. However in the UK the turtle indicates sea dwelling species of Chelonians. The word generally refers to chelonians with flippers that spend the major portion of their lives in water.
                    
                    Tortoises: The word refers to land dwelling, non-swimming chelonians. They have legs and feet, as opposed to the flippers of the other members of the group.

                <h3>Threats to these creatures</h3><br>
                <p>Many of the 327 species that are alive chelonians which have since been identified are endangered. Currently existing sea turtles include seven different species. Six of them are threatened or endangered due to human behavior or way of life. The following are a few of the greatest dangers to turtles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Entanglement in fishing gear: Incidental capture in fishing nets and lines is the greatest threat faced by sea turtles and much other sea life today. About 40% of the animals caught are discarded as trash. A longline containing thousands of baited hooks may be tens of miles long, catching innumerable unintended victims.</li><br>
                    <li>Poaching and illegal trade of eggs, meat, and shells: Despite laws protecting sea turtles on many countries, illegal poaching continues to be a huge problem. The meat and eggs are used for consumption while the skin and shell are used to make various objects such as jewellery, sunglasses, etc.</li><br>
                    <li>Coastal development: Many coastal areas which are sea turtles use for nesting are being developed. This has resulted in a loss of habitat or pollution of the nesting beaches.</li><br>
                    <li>Plastic and other marine debris: Hundreds of thousands of marine life die each year from injestion or entanglement of marine debris or plastic.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Global warming</li><br>
                </ul>
