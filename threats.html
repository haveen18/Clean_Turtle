            <h3>Natural predators</h3><br>
            <p>In nature, sea turtles face a host of life and death obstacles to their survival. Predators such as raccoons, crabs and ants raid eggs and hatchlings still in the nest. Once they emerge, hatchlings make bite-sized meals for birds, crabs and a host of predators in the ocean. After reaching adulthood, sea turtles are relatively immune to predation, except for the occasional shark attack. These natural threats, however, are not the reasons sea turtle populations have plummeted toward extinction. To understand what really threatens sea turtle survival, we must look at the actions of humans.</p><br><br>
            <h3>Its conservation effects</h3><br>
            <p>Presently, there are five species of turtles that are taken care of in the hatchery and rescue centre. Such species are the Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle. The facilities of the sea turtle hatchery and rescue centre are all state-of-the-art, complete with water tanks to care for newborn turtles, along with adult turtle species that have been rescued from the sea due to injuries. One of the more peculiar sights in the centre is the area in which the turtles lay their eggs, as they have distinct little mounds of sand piled neatly between one another. Each of these mounds is monitored closely to calculate the hatching process of the turtle eggs.</p>
